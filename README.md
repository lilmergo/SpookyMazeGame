# The Spooky CrustMAZEcean
## BC Hacks spookiest game! w(ﾟДﾟ)w

***

### Inspiration
We wanted a stressful but fun game that could capture the fear that Halloween is all about. We chose the cave setting and the crab antagonist because we agreed that drowning in a cave would really suck, and crabs are super freaky in a bizarre unexplainable way.

### What it does
6 friends can join together to play a game of cat and mouse in an underwater labyrinth. 1 is the hunter the rest are the prey trying to escape. It is hosted online. Three games can be played at once on the server, with 6 people per lobby.

### How we built it
We built it using Unity with C#, sharing progress over GitHub. Servers were hosted by Photonpun.

### Challenges we ran into
Routine algorithms to make mazes were a pain in the neck - most guided tutorials focus on 3d generation of mazes, and translating this to work alongside unity's 2d tilemap was somewhat confusing. Unity and Github are sworn, enemies.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
The maze works! The art is also really cool and we're proud of it. The online system also works which is dope! We can make rooms and join them as intended. As well, we are incredibly proud to have placed second in the BCHacks Lite hackathon for this project!

### What we learned
Unity is more difficult to use alongside Github compared to other software. Like a lot harder. But that being said we did learn how to coexist with it (sorta). 12 hours is not enough time to do what we wanted to do.

### What's next for the Spooky CrustMAZEcean?
Polish up the game!

- Perfect our spawn points within the procedurally generated map.
- Add all the outcome screens, (Player death, Hunter win, etc)
- Make sure animations work according to input (bubble animation, crab animation, death animation, etc.)
- add audio (folley art, dialogue)
- Implement our fonts throughout and colour scheme throughout the project.
- format home screen buttons
- Add in our loading/instructions/lore screen
- Add perimeter view scripts
- Etc... there is a lot we want to do. We got really invested in this project and bit off way more than we could chew.

##### All the art and sounds in parentheses is done already, just not implemented. So are the loadings/outcome screen. As well as our perimeter script.

### Installation Instructions
To try the game, clone our repository and open "CrustMAZEcean.exe" then click insert name type a username to join the server, then click on make room and put a code (can be whatever just no more than 10 characters), 5 other players can join you online, by entering a username, and clicking join room and putting in the code you made previously. Once everyone is in the game the host will press K to initialize the map
Once in-game everyone moves with WASD the divers search the map for the exit, while the crab tries to kill em' by pressing left click when close. The crab can also restart the map by pressing K again.
